Everything in src/type and the scheme code in (gi type) forms the
guile-gi types system.  It defines some GOOPS base classes, then
provides functions to convert GObject-Introspection types into GOOPS
types.

It also provides code to define new GObject classes in scheme.

src/type should depend only on src/core
