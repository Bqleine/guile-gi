@unnumbered Preface
Guile GI is a Guile package that hopes to provide access for
GObject-based libraries such as GTK+, GLib, WebKitGTK+ and many more.

It supports GNU/Linux, and has only been tested with Guile-2.2. Guile
GI, including this documentation, is licensed under the LGPLv2.1+

If you want to write a Guile application for GNOME or a Guile GUI
application using GTk+, then Guile GI (when it is finished) will be
the way to go.

@node Getting Started, Tutorials, Preface, Top
@chapter Getting Started

To get things started, we will try to run a very simple GTK+ based GUI
application using the bindings provided by Guile GI.

First, create a @code{(Gtk)} Guile module and a @code{(Gio)} Guile
module.

@example
guile -L . -c '(use-modules (gi)) (display (export-typelib "Gtk" "3.0"))' > Gtk.scm
guile -L . -c '(use-modules (gi)) (display (export-typelib "Gio" "2.0"))' > Gio.scm
@end example

The, a minimal GTK application looks like this

@lisp
(use-modules (gi)
	     (Gtk)
	     (Gio)
	     )

(load-typelib "Gtk" "3.0")
(load-typelib "Gio" "2.0")

(define (print-hello widget data)
  (display "Hello World\n"))

(define (activate app user-data)
  (let ((window (GtkApplicationWindow-new app))
	(button-box (GtkButtonBox-new 0))
	(button (GtkButton-new-with-label "Hello World")))
    (GtkWindow-set-title window "Window")
    (GtkWindow-set-default-size window 200 200)
    (GtkWidget-show-all window)

    (GtkContainer-add window button-box)

    (signal-connect button "clicked" print-hello #f)
    (signal-connect button "clicked" (lambda x
				       (GtkWidget-destroy window)) #f)
    (GtkContainer-add button-box button)
    (GtkWidget-show-all window)))

(define (main)
  (let ((app (GtkApplication-new "org.gtk.example" 0)))
    (signal-connect app "activate" activate #f)
    (GioApplication-run app (length (command-line)) (command-line))))

(main)
@end lisp

When it is run, it will create an empty window with a title.  Are you
impressed?

The library has no proper build system yet.  It just has a simple
@file{Makefile}.  If you are lucky, just typeing ``make'' may build
it.

@chapter Reference Guide

The Guile GI project provides a Guile module @file{(gi)}.  The
@file{(gi)} module is an interface for dynamically creating Guile
modules for GObject-based libraries by examining the information in
their @file{.typelib} files.

@section Typelib introspection procedures

A GObject typelib file contains information on the public classes,
functions, and variables in a GObject-based library, and most
GObject-complient libraries, such as GLib and GTK, provide one.
Usually these files are on the filesystem in a single directory
location.  On Fedora, for example, these files may be stored in
@file{/var/lib64/girepository-1.0}.

@deffn Procedure get-typelib-search-path
This returns, as a list of strings, the current search path used to find
typelib files.

If it returns an empty list, this indicates that it is only searching
the default typelib directory.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure prepend-typelib-search-path directory
Given @var{directory}, a string representation of a filesystem
directory, this prepends that directory to the typelib search path.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure export-typelib namespace version
Given @var{namespace}, a string that names a typelib library, such as
``Gtk'' or ``GLib'', and @var{version}, a string that names a version
of a typelib library, like ``2.0'' or ``3.0'', this procedure parses a
typelib file and generates the Scheme source code for a binding to the
library.  The source code is returned as a string, which you should
save to a file.

The procedure may throw an error if a typelib file corresponding to
@var{namespace} and @var{version} cannot be found.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure import-typelib namespace version
Given @var{namespace}, a string that names a typelib library, such as
``Gtk'' or ``GLib'', and @var{version}, a string that names a version
of a typelib library, like ``2.0'' or ``3.0'', this procedure parses a
typelib file and generates procedures, constants, and types which are
loaded into the current environment.

The procedure may throw an error if a typelib file corresponding to
@var{namespace} and @var{version} cannot be found.

This procedure implicitly calls @code{load-typelib}.

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure load-typelib namespace version
Given @var{namespace}, a string that names a typelib library, such as
``Gtk'' or ``GLib'', and @var{version} a string that names a version
of a typelib library , like ``2.0'' or ``3.0'', this procedure reads a
typelib file, and indexes the information in the typelib file into
several hash tables.  The hash tables are created in the current
environment, and have names such as @code{%gi-constants} and
@code{%gi-functions}.

The procedure may throw an error if a typelib file corresponding to
@var{namespace} and @var{version} cannot be found.

The return value is unspecified.
@end deffn

@defvar %gi-constants
@defvarx %gi-enums
@defvarx %gi-flags
@defvarx %gi-functions
@defvarx %gi-methods
@defvarx %gi-callbacks
@defvarx %gi-structs
@defvarx %gi-unions
@defvarx %gi-objects
@defvarx %gi-interfaces
@defvarx %gi-signals
These are all hash tables generated by @code{load-typelib}.  They
contain information parsed from a typelib file and indexed for easier
access by procedures such as @code{gi-constant-value} and
@code{gi-function-invoke}.
@end defvar

@deffn gi-constant-value name
@deffnx gi-flag-value category name
@deffnx gi-enum-value category name
@deffnx gi-struct-ref ptr type-name field-name
@deffnx gi-struct-set ptr type-name field-name value
@deffnx gi-function-invoke name [args...]
@deffnx gi-method-prepare name [args...]
@deffnx gi-method-send object list-of-args
@deffnx gi-lookup-type name
@deffnx gi-lookup-callback-info name
These procedures are used to generate the bindings.  They lookup
introspection information stored in hash tables generated by the
@code{load-typelib} procedure and convert between C and Guile types.

They are used in the procedures generated by @code{export-typelib} and
@code{import-typelib}.
@end deffn

@c -----------------------------------------------------------------
@node GObject types,  , typelib introspection procedures, Reference Guide
@section GObject Types

If you inspect the bindings generated by @code{load-repository}, you
will notice many references to the helper functions
@code{gi-function-invoke}, @code{gi-method-prepare}, and
@code{gi-method-send}.  These procedures convert Guile parameters and
return values to GObject-friendly C parameters and return values.

If you look at the bindings generated by @code{export-typelib}, the
comments and docstrings indicate the types expected by the procedures.

For integer and string arguments, the C to Guile conversions are the
obvious ones. But for GObject types, things get a bit more complex.
GObject has three classes of custom types: structs, unions, and
objects.

GObject unions and structs are handled in Guile-GI by storing them in
a @code{<GBox>} foreign object type.  @code{<GBox>} types are
typically opaque.  The can be created and by GObject functions and
used as arguments, but, their contents aren't otherwise modifyiable.

GObject objects are stored in a @code{<GObject>} foreign object type.
They have slightly more interactivity available at the Guile layer.
They have properties that can be queried and Guile procedures can be
hooked into the GObject callback layer, which GObject calls ``signals''.

@deffn Procedure gobject-type-name obj
Given @var{obj}, a GObject, this returns that name of its type as a
string.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure gobject-get-property obj prop
@deffnx Procedur gobject-set-property! obj prop val
Given @var{obj}, a GObject and  @var{val}, a string name of an object property,
these procedures get and set properties of the GObject.
@end deffn

@deffn Procedure signal-connect obj signal-name procedure rest
Given @var{obj}, a GObject instance, @var{signal-name}, @var{procedure},
a procedure to be used as a callback, and @var{rest}, this attaches
the callback procedure to the object so that it is called when the
GObject signal is emitted.
