# Guile GI

This is a library for GNU Guile.  GNU Guile is an implementation of
Scheme, which is a Lisp-like language.

This library hopes to allow Guile to use GObject-based libraries, such
as GTK+3.  GObject libraries are shared object libraries that have
been written in a standardized way to make them easy to use from other
languages.  GObject libraries come with metadata that describes the
functions and procedures in the library.

This is pre-alpha code.  It barely works.  The API is in flux.

Guile GI has two primary components
- (gi) aka gi.scm: a guile module that provides functions to parse
  GObject typelib files
- libguile-gi.so or libguile-gi.dll: a compiled module that contains
  glue code to interface with GObject

Note that it doesn't come with bindings to GTK3 or GLib out of the
box, but, you can use this library to generate those bindings
automatically.

For the moment, the docs are at https://spk121.github.io/guile-gi/

Try:

    guix environment --ad-hoc -l guix.scm guile
    guile-gi test/example-1.scm
    guile-gi test/browser.scm

Or, create and run in a development environment

    guix environment -l guix.scm
    ./bootstrap && ./configure && make
    tools/uninstalled-env tools/guile-gi test/browser.scm
    tools/uninstalled-env tools/guile-gi test/editor.scm
